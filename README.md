# Analyse-de-donnees-avec-R

The economic analysis of major global powers is crucial for understanding global economic dynamics. In this project, we leverage an extensive dataset compiled from World Bank data to analyze economic trends over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2020.

The dataset covers a wide range of economic indicators that will help us conduct in-depth analyses of economic trends, identify correlations and emerging patterns, and provide insights for policymakers, businesses, and economic forecasts.The primary goal of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the global economy by examining the economic performance of major economies and highlighting implications for global economic growth. 

Before delving into our analysis, let's take a closer look at the key variables in our dataset.:

## Qualitative Variables
Country Name: The name of the country (Among the 6 countries we will study)

## Quantitative Variables
Year:This variable represents the year in which economic data was collected or recorded.

GDP (current US$): Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year, measured in current US dollars.

GDP, PPP (current international $): GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusts GDP for differences in purchasing power between countries, allowing for more accurate comparisons of economies.

GDP per capita (current US$): GDP per capita is a measure of GDP divided by the total population of a country, providing an estimate of average wealth per person.

GDP growth (annual %): GDP growth is the rate of change in GDP from one year to the next, expressed as a percentage.

Imports of goods and services (% of GDP): Imports of goods and services represent the total value of goods and services imported relative to a country's GDP, expressed as a percentage.

Exports of goods and services (% of GDP): Exports of goods and services represent the total value of goods and services exported relative to a country's GDP, expressed as a percentage.

Central government debt, total (% of GDP): Central government debt represents the total amount of debt accumulated by a country's central government relative to its GDP, expressed as a percentage.

Total reserves (includes gold, current US$): Total reserves include a country's international reserves, including gold, measured in current US dollars.

Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modelled ILO estimate): Unemployment rate represents the percentage of the total workforce that is unemployed relative to the total workforce, estimated by the International Labour Organization (ILO).

Inflation, consumer prices (annual %): The inflation rate measures the annual change in consumer prices, expressed as a percentage.

Personal remittances, received (% of GDP): Personal remittances received represent the total amount of funds sent by foreign nationals to their home country, expressed as a percentage of GDP.
Population, total: Total population represents the total number of inhabitants in a country.

Population growth (annual %): Population growth rate measures the annual change in the number of inhabitants in a country, expressed as a percentage.

Life expectancy at birth, total (years): Life expectancy at birth represents the average number of years a newborn can expect to live, assuming current mortality rates remain unchanged.
Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population): The poverty headcount ratio measures the proportion of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day, adjusted for purchasing power parity, expressed as a percentage of the total population.
